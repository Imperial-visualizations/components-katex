# ImpVis KaTeX Components

This repository contains the codebase for components that depend on the KaTeX rendering library, a JS library used for rendering TeX, LaTeX and associated code as HTML. Currently included in this repository are two components:
- **EquationBox** - for rendering simple LaTeX equations
- **EquationBoxAdvance** - a more advanced equation rendering box, with props to display an explantion of said equation on hover over. *This component is currently not working as expected - please feel free to fix, see Issues page for details*

Original source code for these components were written by Robert Jones. 

This package is currently maintained by Robert King.
